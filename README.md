## Introduction

Network traffic classification plays a crucial role in identifying and categorizing network traffic for security and performance analysis. In this project, we explore the use of the BERT Transformer model for network traffic classification. The model is trained on a dataset of network packets labeled as benign or malicious.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Network-Traffic-Classification-using-BERT-Transformer.git
   cd Network-Traffic-Classification-using-BERT-Transformer
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Follow the instructions provided in the code to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains network traffic data captured from different sources. The dataset is divided into benign and malicious traffic. The preprocessed data is used to train and evaluate the classification model.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing step involves loading the network traffic data, removing irrelevant features, and transforming the text data into a format suitable for the BERT Transformer.

## Training

The training process includes configuring the BERT model, training it on the preprocessed data, and optimizing the model using AdamW optimizer.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Results

The results of the network traffic classification using the BERT Transformer are presented in the code. The accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report provide insights into the model's performance on both training and testing datasets.
